00:00:18.733 --> 00:00:21.133
Economic constraints prevent more than one

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.066
third of the global population

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.300
from affording a healthy diet.

00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:27.666
What can we do to help these people?

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:30.800
We found that soybean is cold and drought resistant,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.866
high in protein and healthy fats.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.000
It can also improve soil quality,

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.100
make it one of the best choices for cultivation

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.133
in impoverished areas.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:42.800
We are delighted to see the potential of soybeans

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.166
in malnutrition-

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.333
poverty dilemma.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.333
How about transform soybeans to

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:49.166
kill two birds with one stone?

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.100
Nodule is a dense structure at the roots of soybeans,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000
featuring a natural microaerobic environment,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.166
which is precious,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.166
because microaerobic

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:01.366
nutrient is expensive for its demanding production.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.266
We decided to make use of it

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:06.300
by producing microaerobic nutrients within it.

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.733
So what we could actually produce?

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:10.200
Inspired by an interview,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.666
we pay attention to omega-3 PUFA,

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.666
which includes EPA and DHA in fish oil.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.100
Instead of catching deep-sea fish,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.466
why not use our "Nododule Factory"?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.000
We plan to engineer

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.766
rhizobia living in the nodule to produce EPA

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:28.666
and DHA, turning nodule into an intelligent factory.

00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:32.100
With this idea, we carry out the following experiments

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.133
excitedly.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.300
We chose a kind of rhizobium, Sinorhizobium fredii

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.066
CCBAU45436 as chassis,

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:41.266
building up a set

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:44.300
of regulation module in response to the changes of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.766
nitrogen and oxygen.

00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.966
Meanwhile, we selected genes encoding PUFA

00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:51.500
synthase and dipeptidyl aldehyde

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.766
to preliminarily demonstrate the feasibility of

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:56.566
"microarabic factory".

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.766
In order to improve its efficiency,

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:01.333
we adjusted the expression of relevant genes

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:01.666
and

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:05.100
designed the suicide circuit to avoid chassis leakage.

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.733
PHB is an endogenous metabolite

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:10.966
of our chassis with high expression, phaC2

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:13.000
deletion causes decline

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500
of PHB synthesis in the chassis,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000
so that the content of acetyl-CoA

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.533
can relatively increase,

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:23.333
providing sufficient substrate for the synthesis of PUFA.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.300
glnK promoter is an endogenous

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.400
inducible promoter that is activated under

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.200
low nitrogen conditions.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.500
nifH promoter is also endogenous and inducible

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.000
and is activated under

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.766
low oxygen conditions.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:40.100
We introduced the CRISPRi system to form the "AND gate"

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.466
for more accurate regulation.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.766
The non-cleavage-active Cas12k protein

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:47.466
binds reversibly to

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:50.666
target sequences under the guidance of sgRNA.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:54.200
It physically blocks transcription without cutting

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.000
DNA.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.866
Signaling is used to achieve binding and dissociation

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:02.900
of Cas12k regulating gene expression and repression.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.133
When rhizobia are free

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.366
under high oxygen and low nitrogen,

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:10.166
or when rhizobia perform nitrogen-fixing function

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.966
by symbiotic colonization with plant roots

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:15.333
under low oxygen and low nitrogen,

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:17.333
the glnK promoter initiates the

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.733
expression of sgRNA-GFP,

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.066
which guides the constitutively expressed Cas12k

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:24.366
to bind to the gfp

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:25.600
gene sequences,

00:03:25.733 --> 00:03:27.366
thus blocking the initiation

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:29.933
of downstream genes by the nifH promoter.

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:32.166
And in the later stage of plant growth,

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.133
supplemental application of

00:03:34.133 --> 00:03:35.400
nitrogen fertilizer

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.800
elevates the nitrogen content in the soil,

00:03:37.866 --> 00:03:41.000
which made the activity of glnK promoter decrease.

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:45.100
The expression of sgRNA-GFP decreases as a result.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:48.533
So Cas12k is unable to effectively deter downstream

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:49.600
gene expression,

00:03:49.733 --> 00:03:52.200
thus realizing the initiation of downstream

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.000
synthetic gene expression by the nifH promoter

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.333
under hypoxic conditions.

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:03.200
pfa biosynthetic gene cluster encodes PUFA

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.933
synthases catalyzing synthesis of DHA,

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:09.600
EPA and many other polyunsaturated fatty acids.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.666
It is the downstream gene of regulation module.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:15.933
We also chose the dipeptide aldehyde synthesis gene

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:18.866
bgc33-sfp as downstream gene

00:04:18.866 --> 00:04:20.133
for verification.

00:04:20.166 --> 00:04:22.500
In the design of the suicide circuit,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.400
we used CRISPRi system and the endogenous toxin

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.566
antitoxin system

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:27.666
of the chassis.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.100
vapC encodes toxin, and vapB encodes antitoxin.

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:33.400
The expression of these

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.900
genes is regulated by the promoters nifH and glnK.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.366
Under high oxygen

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:42.100
expression of vapB is suppressed, and under low nitrogen

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.966
the CRISPRi system is activated to suppress

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:46.533
expression of vapC.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.366
When rhizobium escapes from nodules to the high-nitrogen,

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:52.566
high oxygen external environment

00:04:52.733 --> 00:04:55.133
vapC will be expressed normally,

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:58.266
while vapB expression is suppressed by the high

00:04:58.266 --> 00:04:59.800
oxygen conditions.

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.533
Toxin level exceeds antitoxin

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:04.533
ultimately triggers suicide.

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:08.200
In PHB deletion module,

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.366
we successfully constructed the recombination plasmid

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.400
and introduced it into chassis.

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:17.666
We used transmission electron microscope to observe

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:20.466
bacterial solution of the platform stage.

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:24.000
the wild-type contained obvious PHB particles,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.100
while âˆ†phaC2 mutant contained no or less of that.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.566
Later, TLC identified that deletion of PHB

00:05:30.566 --> 00:05:33.600
could increase raw material of fatty acids.

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.666
we also carried out plant system validation.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.900
there were no significant differences between

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.566
wild-type and mutant-inoculated plants

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:43.166
on phenotype. We

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:45.600
identifies that deletion of phaC2

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.766
did

00:05:45.766 --> 00:05:48.733
not affect the normal functions of rhizobium and the

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:50.200
growth of plants.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.933
To test the efficiency of the regulation module,

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:57.466
we detected the fluorescence intensity.

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:00.400
We transfer the plasmid for dipeptide

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.566
aldehyde synthesis in E. coli

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:05.900
into S. fredii and conducted plant experiment.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.466
for phenotypes and nodule sections

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:10.733
there were no significant differences, which

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:13.533
identified that the synthesis module did not stress

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:15.733
the normal functions of rhizobium.

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:16.733
Afterwards,

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:20.366
RT-qPCR and direct mass spectrometr

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.800
dipeptide aldehyde was synthesized successfully.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.700
To verify the feasibility of phaC2 deletion and PUFA

00:06:27.733 --> 00:06:29.966
cluster transfer in Sinorhizobium,

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.733
we use the flux balance analysis.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.400
it relies on previous studies instead of

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.333
detailed kinetic parameters,

00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:39.866
simulating the complete

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:43.600
metabolic Passway and predicting the yield of DHA.

00:06:43.666 --> 00:06:46.700
By calculating the relevant reaction equations,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.066
we got the result of maximizing DHA

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.266
yield, which is very substantial.

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:54.966
We successfully constructed the recombination

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.700
plasmid containing pfa

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.533
biosynthetic gene cluster,

00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:00.900
and transported into our chassis.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.466
RT-qPCR was employed to quantify transcription

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.100
level of the gene cluster.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.666
We also conducted TLC and gas chromatography,

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:12.766
whose results are in line with the RT-qPCR,

00:07:12.766 --> 00:07:14.366
confirming that our chassis

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:16.733
can perform synthesis function normally.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.500
Since we want to increase the productivity of EPA and

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.066
DHA,  we aim to find the most influential factors

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:25.866
by modeling.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.400
Considering DHA synthesis will change over time

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.966
and qualitative analysis is required

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:36.300
the ODEs model meets the need,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:39.366
which replaces the previous FBA model.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:42.500
After listing equations based on design,

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.533
we plotted the time dependent curve of DHA yield

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.733
with a sensitive analysis

00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:51.666
to investigate the main affecting factors.

00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:55.900
It was found that the activity of the PUFA synthase

00:07:56.066 --> 00:07:58.900
has a significant effect on the results

00:07:58.966 --> 00:08:01.300
and is regulated by nitrogen,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.133
so a nitrogen absorption model is established.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:06.900
based on the analysis,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.166
we should continuously adjust the

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:11.266
nitrogen concentration in the future

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.933
and make the peak of nitrogen absorption coincide

00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:16.733
with the synthetic stage.

00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:20.466
To verify the feasibility of the suicide circuit,

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:24.066
we simulated the mechanism of it using ODEs

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:26.600
and took the time factor into account.

00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:28.600
Then, we constructed

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.933
equations for four different conditions,

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:33.133
including corresponding parameters

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:35.666
to simulate the actual situation.

00:08:35.866 --> 00:08:39.000
By calculating the net amount of toxin VapC,

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.366
we found that

00:08:40.366 --> 00:08:43.533
transferred Sinorhizobium indeed accumulates

00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:44.333
VapC

00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:47.733
only after escaping, which leads to death.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.566
Finally,

00:08:48.566 --> 00:08:51.966
we fitted the four conditions in chronological order,

00:08:52.266 --> 00:08:55.933
and the amount of net toxin changed as expected.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.733
We utilized the fluorescence

00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:00.966
expression intensity and found that

00:09:00.966 --> 00:09:02.333
under low oxygen,

00:09:02.466 --> 00:09:02.900
different

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:05.733
nitrogen concentrations significantly affected the

00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.000
expression intensity

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.766
of fluorescent proteins.

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:09.600
It verifies

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.533
that the CRISPRi system functioned properly.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.000
Then we added different concentrations of ammonia

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.366
Chloride to the strains with suicide circuit plasmid,

00:09:20.366 --> 00:09:23.733
and investigated the changes of living bacteria after

00:09:23.733 --> 00:09:26.966
same interval under hyperoxic conditions.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.466
After a period of time,

00:09:28.466 --> 00:09:31.733
the OD 600 value of the bacterial solution

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:33.700
with additional nitrogen source

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.200
showed a decreasing trend

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.100
and the decreasing trend was more obvious

00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:40.133
with the increase of the nitrogen.

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.166
Under this experimental condition,

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:43.800
it can be considered that

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.700
our suicide

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.866
circuit can be regulated by nitrogen concentration

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:50.700
and the overall construction is successful.

00:09:50.733 --> 00:09:54.333
Besides, under high nitrogen and high oxygen conditions,

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:56.466
colonies cultured for five days

00:09:56.466 --> 00:09:58.100
showed a transparent color

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.100
differed from those

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.733
cultured for three days in milky white color,

00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:03.133
this is the most direct

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:04.533
evidence that the suicide

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.966
circuit was successfully constructed.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:09.566
In conclusion,

00:10:09.566 --> 00:10:13.066
we successfully build a sensitive regulation system

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.200
with a coherent group of parts.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.866
Future can build upon this system

00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:20.566
to diversify the downstream products,

00:10:20.566 --> 00:10:22.766
turning the nodule factory into a

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:24.800
biological factory with infinite

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.933
possibilities,

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:28.133
exactly the N. FACTORY!

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.733
What's more, we found that lots of team

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:32.866
had a similar need to predict yield,

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:36.866
so we created a software POMPC based on the DHA model.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.700
By using it,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.566
we can input substrate concentrations and get

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:44.266
the dynamics of product in each pathway.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.800
The software not only

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.266
solves the difficulties of our project,

00:10:48.466 --> 00:10:50.766
but also helps other teams concerned

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:53.100
with the complex metabolic pathways

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.700
to analyze substrate interactions.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.700
In addition,

00:10:57.066 --> 00:10:59.800
we have constructed a nodule formation model

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:03.466
to assist other teams who are interested in rhizobia

00:11:03.566 --> 00:11:05.366
to gain a deeper understanding.

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:09.400
Furthermore, we also constructed the NtrC protein-

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.533
DNA docking model

00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:13.933
to verify the feasibility of nitrogen regulation

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.300
in other rhizobia,

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.133
expanding the extensibility of our Nodule Factory.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.100
Human practices matters at every stage of our project,

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:23.600
helping

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.933
bring Nodule Factory from laboratory to reality.

00:11:27.366 --> 00:11:30.866
From the initial idea to the completion of the project,

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:34.933
we conducted extensive interviews and benefited a lot.

00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:36.566
Our final idea

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:39.000
was confirmed by the African Agriculture

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.100
Extension Worker.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.700
Meanwhile, the iGEM philosophy has

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.500
never advocated building castles in the air,

00:11:45.966 --> 00:11:48.166
we paid attention to the downstream,

00:11:48.333 --> 00:11:52.066
imagine the final product form S. fredii inoculant

00:11:52.133 --> 00:11:54.133
with matched instructions.

00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:57.000
What's more, we designed a supporting machine.

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.000
By reviewing the literature,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.166
we found that nutrients

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:03.100
in nodules could be transported to soybeans

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.600
through transmembrane transport,

00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:07.300
which could make a leap in soybean quality

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.533
and extend a series of soy products

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:10.500
in the future.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Our products

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.766
are affordable nutrition for low-income people,

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.566
and the professor who makes soy ice cream said

00:12:17.666 --> 00:12:20.733
he would like to use our soy as a raw material.

00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:23.700
Africa usually produces soybean oil,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.166
if we can produce high

00:12:25.166 --> 00:12:27.733
value added soy products such as ice cream,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.300
it will stimulate the local

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.533
economy and perform the processing industry chain.

00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:33.866
In addition,

00:12:33.866 --> 00:12:37.200
we contribute to these sustainable development goals.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:41.166
Nodule factory can solve the dual dilemma of

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.666
malnutrition and low income

00:12:42.666 --> 00:12:44.333
from four dimensions.

00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:46.166
It

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:49.500
provides a novel paradigm for microaerobic production

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.933
within nodule by diversifying downstream products.

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:55.000
It is an inclusive production

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.100
platform that can be continuously

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.933
updated and developed.

00:12:59.566 --> 00:13:02.100
Compared to general microbial fermentation,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.300
it eliminates the need for additional

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.500
equipment and human resources.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.366
It avoids chemical pollution,

00:13:08.466 --> 00:13:10.366
so it is an eco-friendly,

00:13:10.366 --> 00:13:13.900
responsible and sustainable production workshop.

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:16.800
It develops the nodule economy,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.366
enhancing individual income and promoting

00:13:19.366 --> 00:13:21.533
local agriculture development.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.066
Governments can improve the economy with

00:13:25.066 --> 00:13:26.666
lower public spending.

00:13:26.666 --> 00:13:30.400
By producing relative expensive microaerobic nutrients

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.600
at low coast, it promotes affordable and healthy diets,

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.066
contributing to reduce

00:13:36.066 --> 00:13:38.800
stunted children and increase breast milk

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.066
nutrition, helping eliminate

00:13:41.066 --> 00:13:44.500
malnutrition and reduce the low income population,

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.733
so as to help

00:13:45.733 --> 00:13:49.900
narrow health disparities and reduce social inequality.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.700
In the future,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.166
people will be able to eat

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.666
cheap nutrients produced by nodules,

00:13:55.666 --> 00:13:58.400
growing soybeans will become more profitable,

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.066
soybeans will enrich the land, soy products

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:02.533
factories will mushroom,

00:14:02.533 --> 00:14:05.933
and then people will become healthy and wealthy!
